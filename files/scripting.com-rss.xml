			<description>There are two fundamental approaches to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=outliner&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/a&gt;, and until now I've never felt the need to find a simple explanation of the difference. And I don't yet have a concise explanation. The difference goes back to ThinkTank vs Microsoft Word in the 80s. In ThinkTank when you moved an object out one level by pressing shift-tab, the node only took with it its own subs. In Word -- it could take some of its siblings with it. It depends on whether it views the document as a hierarchy or as a word processing document. The difference is also present between Drummer and LogSeq (and I imagine it comes from earlier products such as Org Mode). I'll keep coming back to this discussion, and I welcome input on what's the best way to understand the differences. I imagine in the end the difference will be similar to the difference between paint programs and draw programs, the former that deals with pixels, and the latter with objects. I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/228&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for discussion.</description>

			<title>The Leftovers don't warm up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling a little under the weather the last few days so I decided it was time for a binge-watch of something familiar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Leftovers&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I had watched it when it came out, one episode at a time, over three seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a series that was never meant to be binged, because it became harsh and ridiculous, but I remembered it had a great ending. It was one of those science fiction plots that actually makes sense. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that sputtered out at the end and never explained the mystery -- Leftovers very much does explain itself. And the crazy thing is that I didn't remember the plot until I watched the whole thing and it was explained in the last scene of the last episode of the final season. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to watch the show, here's what I recommend. Watch the first season in its entirety. Then watch the last episode of the last season. You might not understand some of the setup, but you'll totally get the punchline, and it's a good one and worth it. The rest of it is crap imho, and I'm surprised the show has held on to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-leftovers&quot;&gt;high rating&lt;/a&gt;. I think maybe we need to re-review these shows after they've been out there for a few years to see if they hang together as rapid-watches. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing about the show, not sure if it's the cause, but my dreams have been a lot more vivid and annoying the last few nights while I've been doing the binge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday, the last day of the year, totally by coincidence, I did my 50th Peloton ride. It's had a mostly positive effect, but my 66-year-old knees really feel it. Thing about these bodies they don't tell you, joints actually wear out like parts on a car, for example.</description>

			<title>Rollover day</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the first of the month, is rollover day in my blog. I do it on the first of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have done the usual ritual: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put my December sub-outline it its own file in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/12.opml&quot;&gt;the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Emptied out my main blog.opml file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ran a one-line script to remove all references to blog.opml in the index. (See below.)  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Pinged Daytona to index the archived outline. Now Daytona has been rolled over.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Drummer bloggers, you should do something similar when you roll over your blog.opml file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I added a couple of posts to the empty blog.opml outline, which triggered triggered an indexing of blog.opml by Daytona. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Verified that both the old and new stuff is in the index. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Continue blogging until February 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the code I ran in Drummer to do the rollover in Daytona.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;daytona.removeOutlineRefs (&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/blog.opml&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;daytona.ping (&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2021/12.opml&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: More rollover. I had to add rollover to the code in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweets.opml.org/&quot;&gt;tweets.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;. And verify that the GitHub archive of our tweets rolled over at the beginning of the year. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner&quot;&gt;here's the folder&lt;/a&gt; that holds the archive of my tweets. You can see there's now a sub-folder for 2022, alongside the one from 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
