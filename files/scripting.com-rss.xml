			<title>Why not drive a Tesla</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My longtime friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scoble&quot;&gt;Robert Scoble&lt;/a&gt; has owned a Tesla Model 3 for years, and always touts the over-the-air software updates, so he can wake up one morning and find his car has a bunch of new features. Yeah but what if they break users, I kept wondering. How well do they test these instant universal updates before uploading? Well, of course -- they &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; test them. Duh. It's a Silicon Valley company and their fear of breaking users isn't the most important factor in their engineering effort, and that of course is an understatement. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I found out in the latest update. I had the temperature in the car set to 65 degrees, the same temperature I have my house thermostat set to. When I got into my updated car, the temperature was 72. It said so very clearly on the big display in the middle of the dash. So I did what I did before, touched the temperature, up pops the environment panel, but I couldn't find any way to change the temp back to 65. I know how to scan a UI from left to right and top to bottom to find the thing that should be big, in the middle the display. A slider that sets the temperature. It wasn't there. I sat in the car in my garage for a few minutes before I had a brilliant idea. Try doing it on the phone where the UI didn't change. Voila. Back to comfort. I'm in good shape until they auto-update the phone UI. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ˜„&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A bunch of other things were moved around. Why? Developers have their own insights into what users need, and they're always wrong. What users want first and foremost is the UI of the fucking cars to not fucking change! I put the f-word in there twice to emphasize the importance of this idea. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I still have my 2020 Subaru Forester, which I drive at least once a week to take out the garbage (I have a long driveway) and to keep the battery charged and to evict any &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2020/08/30/152537.html?title=howToFightMiceInCars&quot;&gt;mouse families&lt;/a&gt; that might be nesting in the heating system. In all this time, the heating controls, which are just a few knobs on the dashboard, obviously haven't moved or changed. They aren't made of software and therefore can be trusted to stay where they are and continue to work the way they used to work when I first learned how to use them. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the Tesla developers had access to user testing or if they gave a shit about users, they would not have moved the temperature control, and their software certainly wouldn't have changed my temperature setting. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Another longtime friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-carlick&quot;&gt;Dave Carlick&lt;/a&gt;, also drives a Tesla. This is what he wrote about the recent UI changes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/davidscottcarlick/posts/10159365261220609&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Seat position selector? Ha ha ha! Hid it! Swipe on tire pressure? Mwaa ha ha. Hid that too! Cell phone music selector? You'll never find it! Song that is playing? Ha ha ha ha. Keep guessing. Temperature controls? Stop driving right now and hunt around!&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now meanwhile, let me say that I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; driving my Tesla more every week. I sometimes look for excuses to drive somewhere just so I can take my muscle car that looks like a Toyota Camry for a spin. The way it hugs the corners on mountain roads, and accelerates in an instant to pass cars running on gasoline. I love the car. But I wish it behaved more like an old style car in viewing the user interface as immutable. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Marc Andreessen famously said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&quot;&gt;software is eating the world&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe that wasn't the best idea ever? Heh. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;ðŸ’¥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There are two fundamental approaches to &lt;a href=&quot;http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=outliner&amp;collection=scriptingnews&quot;&gt;outliners&lt;/a&gt;, and until now I've never felt the need to find a simple explanation of the difference. And I don't yet have a concise explanation. The difference goes back to ThinkTank vs Microsoft Word in the 80s. In ThinkTank when you moved an object out one level by pressing shift-tab, the node only took with it its own subs. In Word -- it could take some of its siblings with it. It depends on whether it views the document as a hierarchy or as a word processing document. The difference is also present between Drummer and LogSeq (and I imagine it comes from earlier products such as Org Mode). I'll keep coming back to this discussion, and I welcome input on what's the best way to understand the differences. I imagine in the end the difference will be similar to the difference between paint programs and draw programs, the former that deals with pixels, and the latter with objects. I've opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/228&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; for discussion.</description>

			<description>Outlining is different from word processing in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG&quot;&gt;wysiwyg&lt;/a&gt;. So many renderings can come from outlines. It would be great to edit in wizzy mode for every possible rendering. But it's almost as good to have a flip-switch.</description>

			<title>The Leftovers don't warm up</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been feeling a little under the weather the last few days so I decided it was time for a binge-watch of something familiar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leftovers_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;The Leftovers&lt;/a&gt; on HBO. I had watched it when it came out, one episode at a time, over three seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a series that was never meant to be binged, because it became harsh and ridiculous, but I remembered it had a great ending. It was one of those science fiction plots that actually makes sense. Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that sputtered out at the end and never explained the mystery -- Leftovers very much does explain itself. And the crazy thing is that I didn't remember the plot until I watched the whole thing and it was explained in the last scene of the last episode of the final season. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to watch the show, here's what I recommend. Watch the first season in its entirety. Then watch the last episode of the last season. You might not understand some of the setup, but you'll totally get the punchline, and it's a good one and worth it. The rest of it is crap imho, and I'm surprised the show has held on to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-leftovers&quot;&gt;high rating&lt;/a&gt;. I think maybe we need to re-review these shows after they've been out there for a few years to see if they hang together as rapid-watches. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One thing about the show, not sure if it's the cause, but my dreams have been a lot more vivid and annoying the last few nights while I've been doing the binge. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday, the last day of the year, totally by coincidence, I did my 50th Peloton ride. It's had a mostly positive effect, but my 66-year-old knees really feel it. Thing about these bodies they don't tell you, joints actually wear out like parts on a car, for example.</description>

			<title>Rollover day</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the first of the month, is rollover day in my blog. I do it on the first of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I have done the usual ritual: &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Put my December sub-outline it its own file in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2021/12.opml&quot;&gt;the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Emptied out my main blog.opml file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Ran a one-line script to remove all references to blog.opml in the index. (See below.)  &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Pinged Daytona to index the archived outline. Now Daytona has been rolled over.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Drummer bloggers, you should do something similar when you roll over your blog.opml file. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I added a couple of posts to the empty blog.opml outline, which triggered triggered an indexing of blog.opml by Daytona. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Verified that both the old and new stuff is in the index. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Continue blogging until February 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Here's the code I ran in Drummer to do the rollover in Daytona.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;daytona.removeOutlineRefs (&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/blog.opml&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;daytona.ping (&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/Scripting-News/master/blog/opml/2021/12.opml&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;PS: More rollover. I had to add rollover to the code in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweets.opml.org/&quot;&gt;tweets.opml.org&lt;/a&gt;. And verify that the GitHub archive of our tweets rolled over at the beginning of the year. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner&quot;&gt;here's the folder&lt;/a&gt; that holds the archive of my tweets. You can see there's now a sub-folder for 2022, alongside the one from 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
